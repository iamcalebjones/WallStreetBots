## Background

Reddit is a place on the internet. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit) states it is "a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website" which is grouped into pages called subreddits, which contain topic-specific content. Reddit users can join specific to participate in that community's discussion.

There is a subreddit called [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) that exists to discuss stock and options trading. 

## Natural Language Processing

To evaluate this subject, I needed data. At first, I thought it would take a lot of scraping or navigating with the Reddit API to obtain the information, but as it turns out, this topic is suddenly very popular, and someone had already done the legwork and posted it to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mattpodolak/rwallstreetbets-posts-and-comments).
